To style the Date Widget you need to pass a style object with properties that you want to overwrite. These properties will extend the default style object.

Here will be described how to style the panel for the Date widget. For how to style input please refer to [this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/style/intro).

**Panel** here represents the overlay where an user picks a date.

Below you can see an example of how you can style the panel for the Date Widget.
Please pay attention to the comments as they explain how to style elements in the component with respect to property name.

<div id="date-widget-style-api"></div>
<script>
  window.renderDatePanelStyleExample('date-widget-style-api')
  window.scrollTo(0, 0)
</script>
